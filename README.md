deploykit-frontend
==================

Shiny(ish) webapp that is a front end for mcollective based git deploy tool.

WHAT?
=====

Elsewhere on Github, you should be able to find https://github.com/FuturePublishing/future-deploykit
which contains (mcollective) command-line utilities for inspecting available tags in git repos on 
remote machines and optionally deploying same.

Matt wrote this, which is a Sinatra application and some Twitter Bootstrap bits that makes the 
command-line stuff less scary or less open to abuse, depending on which side of dev or ops you
fall on when pushed.

WHY?
====

Deploys that happen rapidly and via a single(ish) click are pretty cool. You should try them.
